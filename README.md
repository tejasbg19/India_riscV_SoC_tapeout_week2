# Task-1 : BabySoC Fundamentals


## üß© 1. Understanding System-on-Chip (SoC)

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is essentially a miniature computer built onto a single silicon chip.  
It integrates all the key components required for computation, communication, and control ‚Äî making it compact, efficient, and highly power-optimized.

For example, in a **traditional computer**, we have a **central CPU core** (from Intel or AMD) mounted on a **motherboard**.  
The motherboard houses all the necessary circuitry and components required for the CPU to function properly ‚Äî such as timers, counters, interrupt controllers, RAM, code memory, HDD interface, clock generators, frequency dividers, I/O controllers, peripheral interfaces, and various protocol handlers.  

This setup is **modular and repairable**, meaning any faulty part (like RAM or storage) can be replaced independently.  
However, it also **occupies more space** and **consumes more power**, since all components are placed on a large PCB and connected through external buses.

In contrast, an **SoC** (like Apple‚Äôs *M-series chips*) integrates all these components ‚Äî the **CPU core, memory, clocking circuits, I/O interfaces, and peripherals** ‚Äî onto a **single silicon wafer**.  
This drastically **reduces area and power consumption**, making SoCs ideal for **portable and low-power devices** such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables.  

The trade-off, however, is **repairability** ‚Äî since everything is fabricated together, replacing or upgrading a single component isn‚Äôt possible.  


### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Key Components of an SoC
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):**  
  Acts as the brain of the system, executing instructions and managing all operations.  

- **Memory:**  
  - **RAM** for temporary data storage during operation/runtime. 
  - **ROM/Flash** for permanent data storage.  

- **I/O Interfaces:**  
  Enable communication with external peripherals like sensors, displays, or network interfaces.  

- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):**  
  Handles image and video rendering.  

- **DSP (Digital Signal Processor):**  
  Specializes in audio, video, and signal processing tasks.  

- **Power Management Unit (PMU):**  
  Controls energy distribution to ensure efficiency and longer battery life.  

- **Connectivity Modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.):**  
  Enable wireless communication and data transfer.  

### üí° Advantages of SoC
- Compact and space-saving.  
- Lower power consumption.  
- Improved processing speed due to shorter data paths.  
- Cost-effective and reliable with fewer interconnections.  

### üì± Applications
Used in smartphones, IoT devices, wearables, automotive systems, and embedded applications and nowadays even in laptops.

## üß± 2. Types of SoCs
1. **Microcontroller-based SoC:**  
   Designed for simple, low-power control applications like home appliances or IoT systems.  

2. **Microprocessor-based SoC:**  
   Designed for higher computational needs ‚Äî found in smartphones and tablets.  

3. **Application-Specific SoC (ASIC-based):**  
   Custom-built for particular applications like AI accelerators, GPUs, or networking hardware.

## üß≠ 3. Introduction to VSDBabySoC  

**VSDBabySoC** is a simplified yet powerful RISC-V based SoC, created for educational and open-source experimentation.  

### üß† Core Components  
- **RVMYTH Processor (RISC-V CPU):**  
  The main processing unit that handles instruction execution. Learn more about RVMYTH [here](https://github.com/kunalg123/rvmyth)

- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL):**  
  Generates a stable and synchronized clock for all modules.  

- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC):**  
  Converts digital data from RVMYTH into analog signals for external output (e.g., sound/video).  

### ‚ö° Internal Operation  
1. **Initialization & Clock Generation:**  
   The PLL locks onto an input reference and produces a stable system clock.  

2. **Data Processing in RVMYTH:**  
   The CPU processes data and writes values to the DAC input register.  

3. **Analog Signal Generation via DAC:**  
   The DAC converts the processed digital values into analog signals, enabling BabySoC to interface with real-world devices such as TVs or speakers.

## ü™Ñ 4. Key Analog IPs in BabySoC  

### üïí Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)
- Maintains phase and frequency alignment with a reference clock.  
- Consists of:  
  - **Phase Detector**  
  - **Loop Filter**  
  - **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**  
- Ensures synchronized operation across digital and analog modules.  

**Why internal PLL is preferred over off-chip clocks:**  
- Reduces distribution delay and clock jitter.  
- Provides multiple frequency domains for different SoC blocks.  
- Maintains timing accuracy despite environmental variations.  

### üéöÔ∏è Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
- Converts digital binary values into continuous analog voltages.  
- Two major types:  
  1. **Weighted Resistor DAC**  
  2. **R-2R Ladder DAC**  
- In BabySoC, a **10-bit DAC** produces precise analog output corresponding to the RVMYTH processor‚Äôs digital output stream.
